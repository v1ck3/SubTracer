# SubTracer
SubTracer is a Python script for subdomain enumeration. It automates discovering subdomains for a given domain and extracting the results into a file.

# SubHunter
SubHunter is a Python script for subdomain enumeration. It automates discovering subdomains for a given domain and extracting the results into a file. 

🛠️ Features

    Subdomain Discovery: Enumerates subdomains for a specified domain using SubHunter.
    Multiple Data Sources: Queries multiple search engines, CT logs, and DNS for subdomain data.
    Terminal & File Output: Prints found subdomains in the terminal and save them to subdomains.txt.
    Error Handling: Gracefully handles errors during enumeration and displays them in the terminal.
    Simple Command-Line Interface: Accepts the target domain as a command-line argument for ease of use.

🚀 Installation & Setup

Prerequisites

Before running the script, you must install Python 3 on your system.

STEPS :

git clone https://github.com/v1ck3/SubHunter.git

cd SubHunter

pip3 install pyfiglet

🖥️ Usage

python3 SubHunter.py <domain>

Example:

python3 SubHunter.py example.com

Output:

    The subdomains will be displayed in the terminal.
    The subdomains will also be saved to subdomains.txt.

Example Output:

Enumerating subdomains for example.com...
Found 15 subdomains for example.com:
www.example.com
mail.example.com
api.example.com
ftp.example.com
dev.example.com
...

The subdomains will also be saved to subdomains.txt in the same directory.
🔧 How It Works

    Input: Accepts the target domain as a command-line argument.
    SubHunter: The script runs SubHunter with the domain and collects subdomains from multiple data sources.
    Processing: The subdomains are extracted from the subdomains.txt output file generated by SubHunter.
    Output: The found subdomains are printed to the terminal and saved to output.txt.

💡 Additional Features (Optional)

    Custom Output Filename: Modify the script to output results to a custom file name.
    Parallel Execution: You could optimize SubHunter by modifying the script for parallel subdomain queries.
    API Integration: Extend the script to fetch subdomains from other APIs like VirusTotal or security services.

⚠️ Troubleshooting

    Error in SubHunter Execution: Ensure SubHunter is properly installed. If you encounter errors, verify that all dependencies are satisfied.
    No Subdomains Found: If SubHunter finds no subdomains, ensure the domain is valid, or try increasing the number of data sources.
